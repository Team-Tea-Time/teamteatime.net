## Introduction

Laravel Forum 5 is a total rewrite of the package with the same philosophy at its core: a simple and robust forum package designed for quick and easy integration into Laravel projects. It serves as a solid foundation for building bespoke discussion forums without being too opinionated, making as few assumptions as possible about your application while leaving the more subjective features and functionality (such as file attachments and WYSIWYG editors) up to you to implement and configure as you see fit.

If you're looking for a more feature-complete forum solution built on Illuminate (the collection of components that power Laravel), take a look at [Flarum](http://flarum.org/) as an alternative.
