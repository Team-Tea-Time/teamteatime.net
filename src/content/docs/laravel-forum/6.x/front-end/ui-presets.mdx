Laravel Forum's UI presets are similar to Laravel's [Starter Kits](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits), but instead of publishing the back-end elements (route definitions, actions, controllers, etc) along with the front-end ones (views, JS, etc), they only publish the latter to your application. The package implements supporting stacks internally and presets can specify which one they require.

## Available Stacks

Currently, two stacks are supported: **Blade** and **Livewire**.

### Blade

This stack uses conventional controller-backed routes that return Blade views. It doesn't require any special dependencies.

### Livewire

This stack, which is built on top of Blade, uses a separate set of routes that are backed by full-page Livewire components. These full-page components are defined by the stack itself, but any presets using it may register additional components to use in views. Views for both the full-page components and any additionally registered ones can be overridden.

Using this stack requires a few dependencies that aren't installed by default in new Laravel projects. The simplest way to install them is to install Laravel's [Breeze and Livewire Starter Kit](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-livewire).

Refer to the [Livewire website](https://livewire.laravel.com/) for more details about Livewire itself.

## Available Presets

Currently, the package ships with three UI presets: **livewire-tailwind**, **blade-tailwind**, and **blade-bootstrap**. By default, it specifies **livewire-tailwind** as the active preset via the `forum.frontend.preset` config option.

To list available presets along with summaries of what they are, run `php artisan forum:preset-list`.

Alternatively, run `php artisan forum:preset-install` to choose a preset to install. You may also pass the name directly as the first argument - for example:

```
php artisan forum:preset-install livewire-tailwind
```

After a preset is installed, it will list the NPM packages it requires along with the `npm install` command to install them for convenience.

<Alert type="info">
    Presets are published to exclusive paths in your application's resources directory. You can find them under `resources/forum`. This enables you to publish multiple presets without causing them to overwrite each other, and you can switch between them by changing the `forum.frontend.preset` config value.
</Alert>

## Contributing Presets

If you'd like to contribute a UI preset, or simply write one to encapsulate your own views and components for the forum, you can do so by following the steps below.

### Step 1: Implement `AbstractPreset`

Define a class that extends `TeamTeaTime\Forum\Frontend\Presets\AbstractPreset`. This specifies several methods that are required for registering and using a preset. At a minimum, the `getName`, `getSummary`, and `getRequiredStack` methods must be implemented, but there are default implementations for other methods that can be overridden if necessary. See [AbstractPreset](https://github.com/Team-Tea-Time/laravel-forum/blob/6.x/src/Frontend/Presets/AbstractPreset.php) for specifics.

As an example, here's the implementation for the `blade-tailwind` preset that ships with the package:

```php
<?php

namespace TeamTeaTime\Forum\Frontend\Presets;

use TeamTeaTime\Forum\{
    Config\FrontendStack,
    Frontend\Traits\RegistersBladeComponents,
};

class BladeTailwindPreset extends AbstractPreset
{
    use RegistersBladeComponents;

    public static function getName(): string
    {
        return 'blade-tailwind';
    }

    public static function getSummary(): string
    {
        return "Blade with Vue and Tailwind CSS.";
    }

    public static function getRequiredStack(): FrontendStack
    {
        return FrontendStack::BLADE;
    }

    public static function getRequiredPackages(): array
    {
        return [
            '@simonwep/pickr',
            'axios',
            'feather-icons',
            'tailwindcss',
            'vue',
            'vuedraggable',
        ];
    }

    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->bladeComponentNamespace("TeamTeaTime\\Forum\\Frontend\\Presets\\BladeTailwind\\Components");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register the Preset

In order for the package to pick up your preset and use it, you must register it via the preset registry.

To do this, in the `register()` method of one of your service providers, resolve the preset registry and use it to register your preset:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Forum\CustomPreset;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use TeamTeaTime\Forum\Frontend\Presets\PresetRegistry;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $presets = $this->app->make(PresetRegistry::class);
        $presets->register(new CustomPreset);
    }
}
```

<Alert type="warning">
    Whichever service provider you use to do this must come **after** the forum service provider in `bootstrap/providers.php`.
</Alert>

At this point, your preset should be listed when you run `php artisan forum:preset-list` or `php artisan forum:preset-install`. If it doesn't, check your logs for errors from the package's service provider.

### Step 3: Activate the Preset

To make the package use your preset, simply set the `forum.frontend.preset` config value to the preset's name.
