Four [Authorization Policies](http://laravel.com/docs/8.x/authorization) are defined to provide default permission checks. You can override them and change the corresponding namespaces specified in the `forum.integration.policies` config value to allow or deny forum abilities to different users.

Note that every policy method must return a boolean (`true` to allow or `false` to deny).

### Forum

```
TeamTeaTime\Forum\Policies\ForumPolicy
```

This policy defines a few top-level abilities that don't apply to a specific category, thread or post.

Methods in this policy accept a `$user` parameter.

| Ability                | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `createCategories`     | Allows creating categories at any level.            |
| `manageCategories`     | Encompasses category modifying/deleting abilities.  |
| `moveCategories`       | Allows relocating and reordering categories.        |
| `renameCategories`     | Allows changing a category's title and description. |
| `markThreadsAsRead`    | Allows marking new/updated threads as read.         |
| `viewTrashedThreads`   | Allows viewing threads that have been soft-deleted. |
| `viewTrashedPosts`     | Allows viewing posts that have been soft-deleted.   |
